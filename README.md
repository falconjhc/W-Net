One-shot Arbitrary-style Chinese Character Generation

It is the basic code implementation of the paper W-Net: One-shot Arbitrary-style Chinese Character Generation in the 24th International Conference on Neural Information Processing (ICONIP-2018), authored by Haochuan JIANG, Guanyu YANG, Kaizhu HUANG and Rui ZHANG from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, SIP, Suzhou, P.R.China.

The code is written based on the Tensorflow Deep Learning Library (r1.90, python=2.7). Additional python dependencies are as follows: pip install matplotlib scipy imageio opencv-contrib-python opencv-python

It is recommended that the python environment is installed on the Anaconda framework.
